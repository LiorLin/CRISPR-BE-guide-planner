## CRISPR Base-editor guide planner

CRISPR-Cas9 systems, originally discovered as part of the adaptive immune system of bacteria, have revolutionized genome editing by enabling precise and efficient DNA modifications using RNA-guided endonucleases. 

In particular, the CRISPR base-editor is an advanced tool that generates single-nucleotide changes without introducing double-strand breaks. This holds great promise for studying genetic variants and therapeutic applications. Designing guide RNAs (gRNAs) for base editing is challenging and requires detailed computation to ensure specificity and efficacy. 

As part of my research on the devastating neurodegenerative disease Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) I aim to model familial SOD1-ALS in a cell-culture. I have already developed cells with the CRISPR base-editor system integrated into their genome, and this tool will help me design guides to create disease-related mutations in these cells.

## Aims 
This project aims to develop a Python-based tool to assist us - students and researchers - in designing gRNAs tailored for CRISPR base-editing. The tool will identify candidate gRNAs and predict their potential edits. It will further assess the biological impact of the induced mutations (causing mis-sense or non-sense mutations, frameshifts etc.) and search for those associated with disease.
